# Danceform
Identify the dance form of an image.

datasets columns are 'Images' (eg. 90.jpg,etc) and 'target'(eg.Pop)

steps:
1.Run hackerearth_model.py first
2.Run hackerearth_test.py

To train on images CNN algorithm has been used.
Try to train with more images for better performance and prediction accuracy.
Increase the number of epochs and try to run the model on GPU for fast processing.

Thank You.
